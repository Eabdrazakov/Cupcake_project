    <h2>About cake</h2>

    <p class="Fleshy">The history of cake dates back to ancient times. The first cakes were very different from what we
        eat today. They
        were more bread-like and sweetened with honey. Nuts and dried fruits were often added. According to the food
        historians, the ancient Egyptians were the first culture to show evidence of advanced baking skills. The Oxford
        English Dictionary traces the English word cake back to the 13th century. It is a derivation of 'kaka', an Old
        Norse word. Medieval European bakers often made fruitcakes and gingerbread. These foods could last for many
        months.</p>

    <p id="Best">According to the food historians, the precursors of modern cakes (round ones with icing) were
        first baked in
        Europe sometime in the mid-17th century. This is due to primarily to advances in technology (more reliable
        ovens, manufacture/availability of food molds) and ingredient availability (refined sugar). At that time cake
        hoops--round molds for shaping cakes that were placed on flat baking trays--were popular. They could be made of
        metal, wood or paper. Some were adjustable. Cake pans were sometimes used. The first icing were usually a boiled
        composition of the finest available sugar, egg whites and [sometimes] flavorings. This icing was poured on the
        cake. The cake was then returned to the oven for a while. When removed the icing cooled quickly to form a hard,
        glossy [ice-like] covering. Many cakes made at this time still contained dried fruits (raisins, currants,
        citrons).</p>

    <p class="Fleshy">It was not until the middle of the 19th century that cake as we know it today (made with extra
        refined white
        flour and baking powder instead of yeast) arrived on the scene. A brief history of baking powder. The Cassell's
        New Universal Cookery Book [London, 1894] contains a recipe for layer cake, American (p. 1031). Butter-cream
        frostings (using butter, cream, confectioners [powdered] sugar and flavorings) began replacing traditional
        boiled icings in first few decades 20th century. In France, Antonin Careme [1784-1833] is considered THE premier
        historic chef of the modern pastry/cake world. You will find references to him in French culinary history
        books..</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between cake, gateau and torte?</h3>

    <p>Gateaux is a French word for cake. It generally denotes items made with delicate ingredients which are best
        consumed soon after the confection is made (gateaux des roi). Cakes can last much longer, some even improving
        with age (fruit cake). Torte is the German word for cake, with similar properties. When tortes are multilayerd
        and fancifully decorated they are closer to gateaux EXCEPT for the fact they can last quite nicely for several
        days.</p>
